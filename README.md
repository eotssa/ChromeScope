# Browser Extension Analysis Tool

## Description

This project provides a tool for analyzing browser extensions. It includes a range of checks and analyses to ensure the security and reliability of browser extensions. The tool evaluates various aspects of an extension, such as metadata, Content Security Policy (CSP), permissions, JavaScript library vulnerabilities, and Chrome API usage. It also integrates ESLint with the `eslint-plugin-security` for static code analysis focused on security-related issues.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Inside the cloned directory, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use this tool, start the server and upload a browser extension file (in ZIP format). The tool will then perform various analyses and return a comprehensive report.

1. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Upload an Extension**

   Make a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/` with a browser extension file. This can be done using a REST client or a form in a frontend application.

3. **View the Analysis Report**

   The response will contain a detailed analysis report of the browser extension.
